# Airbnb Market Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data to uncover pricing dynamics, occupancy trends, and neighborhood-level performance. The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end data analytics workflow: from querying structured data with SQL to communicating insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

The project simulates a real-world data analyst task where business questions are answered using relational queries and visual analytics.
